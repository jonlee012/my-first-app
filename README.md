# My Introductory Project
Welcome to my introductory project! This repository contains the code for a simple project designed to help me learn and experiment with Cloud. It's a great starting point to explore basic concepts, and I hope to expand it further as I continue learning.

Project Overview
This project aims to introduce key concepts of GitHub Action and cloud integration. It’s designed to assist those that are seeking entry level guidance on GitHub Actions. While it’s a beginner-level project, I’ve made sure to focus on clean, readable code and simplicity.

Example:
"This project is a simple 'To-Do List' application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, providing a great foundation for working with DOM manipulation."

Features
Basic Feature 1: Describe a key functionality of your project.
Basic Feature 2: Another feature or functionality.
Basic Feature 3: Any other notable feature or tool used.
